## Phone Tree of Despair

Phone Tree of Despair is a game where you navigate a phone tree while trying to avoid getting stuck on a hold loop. To play this game, you literally call a phone number.

Your goal is to navigate the ~~infuriating~~ expertly designed, user-friendly phone tree to renew your registration! Solve some puzzles along the way, and reflect on how much we all love automated phone systems.

*Warning: This game may frustrate you. It sure frustrated the heck out of me!!* 😡

## How to play:

# Call **+1 (928) 569 9118**

Note: Because you're making a real phone call, this game may cost you money depending on your phone plan. Watch out for international phone call fees if you're not in the US.

Stay tuned for a browser-based version that doesn't need you to make a call!

## The reviews are in! 🗞

## Costs and stuff! 💸

Running this game costs about a dollar each time someone plays through it, so if you want to cover costs, you can send a donation via the itch.io page. If not, that's cool too, but if it goes viral I may have to take it down 😅
